## State Management

The state of the AppBar and other components is managed using the `flutter_bloc` package. This ensures a scalable and maintainable architecture for managing state.

## Parallax Animation

The parallax effect is achieved using a custom `ParallaxFlowDelegate`. This creates a smooth and visually appealing animation for the UI components.
